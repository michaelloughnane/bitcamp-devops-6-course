## That's not much different, so why might you want to use GitHub Script?

With GitHub Script you don't have to worry about

- Building a custom action to create this issue comment.
- No Octokit dependencies to worry about.
- No additional packages to manage.
- No need to write action metadata.
- No need to write source code to handle this Octokit method.

Using GitHub Script instead of writing custom actions for repository related tasks can prove to be a much more light-weight solution in most cases.

Anything you can do with Octokit can be accomplished with GitHub Script ðŸŽ‰!
