## You have added a workflow!

@{{user.login}}, you're a rockstar âœ¨

Your workflow now has the necessary updates for us to have new issues automatically added to the triage board when they are created!

Like before, this workflow has a trigger that pertains to the repository as a whole, rather than just this branch, we will need to merge this pull request before we can start using it.

Let's go ahead and do this now.
