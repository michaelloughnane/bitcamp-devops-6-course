# Success!

@{{user.login}} you're doing great! You've just used GitHub Script to comment on this issue!

## Why might this be useful?

Using GitHub Actions can really help automate the events that take place in your repositories. Imagine it was a repository visitor who opened a new issue containing information about a critical bug. Presumably you'd want to thank them for bringing that to your attention, however this simple task can become overwhelming as your repository attracts more visitors. By automating an issue comment you could easily thank your visitors every single time without the overhead of doing it manually.

## What about us?

For the rest of the course you're going to design a workflow that helps you move issues into a GitHub Project board when they are created. This will give you increased visibility on the work that needs triage!
