# Success ðŸŽ‰!!!

@{{user.login}} you're doing great! You've just used GitHub Script to comment on this issue!

## Why might this be useful?

Using GitHub Actions can really help automate the events that take place in your repositories. Imagine it was a repository visitor who opened a new issue containing information about a critical bug. I assume you'd want to thank them for bringing that to your attention, however this simple task can become overwhelming as your repository attracts more visitors. By automating an issue comment we could easily thank our visitors every single time without the overhead of doing it manually.

## What about us?

For the rest of the course we are going to design a workflow that helps us move issues into a GitHub Project board when they are created. This will give us increased visibility on the work that needs triage!
