## Use the FS module to use a templated comment

Make the following changes to the current workflow file:

- Add the `actions/checkout` action so we can read the templated response file located at `.github/ISSUE_RESPONSES/comment.md`
- Add JavaScript to use the Node.js File System module to place the contents of our templated response as the body of the issue comment.
