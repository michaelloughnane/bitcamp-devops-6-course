## What you learned

As we wrap this course up it's important that we revisit the learning points you encountered along the way.

**Things you learned in this course:**

- What GitHub Script is
- How GitHub Script maps to octokit/rest.js
- How to use the GitHub Script action in your workflow
  - By commenting when an issue is opened
  - By adding an issue to a project board when it is opened
- How to read a file from the repository for use with GitHub Script
- How to apply expressions to a workflow file

That should give you quite the start with incorporating the GitHub Script action into your workflows!

Congratulations on finishing this course. You will receive no further responses from me, however further action taken in this repo could trigger workflow runs, because of this we recommend commenting out the workflow file if you plan to keep this repository for notes!
